  <br>The sound mentioned above is from the anime. Game companies often use music from the anime to make the game more immersive, especially in the story mode, giving players a deeper connection to the game.
  <b>Right down here is a small trailer for the game itself<b>

  <br>In the trailer, you can see what the game will offer once it's complete. Gojo, the character speaking at the end, explains what to expect in the full game trailer, offering insights to inform the viewer about the upcoming features and content.

<br>The characters highlighted in the trailer receive the most screen time in the anime's first season. These individuals are more widely recognized, given their prominence in the initial season, especially considering that the second season has been recently released.

  <br>The individual depicted in the picture is Sukuna, the primary antagonist in the show. The image is a snapshot from a gameplay video showcasing the fighting mode of the game, where players engage in battles, and Sukuna takes on a significant role as a formidable adversary within this mode.

<br>While the game predominantly showcases gameplay elements rather than delving into the story mode, it has the potential to greatly enhance the overall experience by incorporating a diverse range of music and sounds from the anime. Moreover, including the second season's storyline in the game adds depth, seamlessly transitioning players from the show's introductory phases to the heart of the action.
