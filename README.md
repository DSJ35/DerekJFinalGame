  <br>The sound above sound comes from the anime itself. Most of the time, game companies like to incorporate music from the anime so the player can have a more immersive feeling in the game, especially if it's the story mode.
  
<b>Right down here is a small trailer for the game itself

  <br>As you can see, the game shows what will come once it is finished. Gojo, the guy talking at the end, explains what will happen in the game in the full trailer just to inform the viewer.

<br>The characters shown in the trailer have the most screen time in the first season of the anime, which are the people who are more notably known than others since season 2 has recently dropped.

  <br>Sukuna who is the guy shown in the picture, is the first real antagonist in the show and this is a picture from a gameplay video that was shown. Which is the "fighting" mode of the game.
