    <h2>A Study on <i>Jujutsu Kaisen</i> by Byking and Gemdrops: Sounds and Influences in the Game</h2>
  <br>On my website, I aim to delve into the various sounds and influences of Jujutsu Kaisen.

  <br>The sound mentioned above is from the anime. Game companies often use music from the anime to make the game more immersive, especially in the story mode, giving players a deeper connection to the game.
 <br> Right down here is a small trailer for the game itself<br>

  <br>In the trailer, you can see what the game will offer once it's complete. Gojo, the character speaking at the end, explains what to expect in the full game trailer, offering insights to inform the viewer about the upcoming features and content.

  <br>The characters highlighted in the trailer receive the most screen time in the anime's first season. These individuals are more widely recognized, given their prominence in the initial season, especially considering that the second season has been recently released.

  <br>The individual depicted in the picture is Sukuna, the primary antagonist in the show. The image is a snapshot from a gameplay video showcasing the fighting mode of the game, where players engage in battles, and Sukuna takes on a significant role as a formidable adversary within this mode.

<br>While the game predominantly showcases gameplay elements rather than delving into the story mode, it has the potential to greatly enhance the overall experience by incorporating a diverse range of music and sounds from the anime. Moreover, including the second season's storyline in the game adds depth, seamlessly transitioning players from the show's introductory phases to the heart of the action. Due to this, as your characters proceed throughout the story mode and you face off against bosses who were the antagonists of the story, you're going to have a lot of emotion when it comes to either losing or winning a fight to advance.

  <br>Anzieu's article revolves around the concept of a crying child and their connection with the mother. Similarly, in the context of gaming, players often experience a similar emotional dynamic. Just as a crying baby calls for its mother, players, particularly in story modes, strive to avoid failure or death to attain a desired outcome. Much like witnessing a sad scene in the anime narrative, players, too, can feel a sense of gloom and sorrow when they perceive an ending they were not striving to achieve or when they encounter situations where they are powerless to alter the course of events.
